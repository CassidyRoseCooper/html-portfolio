<h1>Best Movies According To Cassidy</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>This movie is timeless and romantic, takes me to another time where everything was classical. The simple story of two people falling inlove captured beautifully.</p>
<h3>Prisoners</h3>
<p>Takes you on a journy of a farther desperately trying to find his kidnaped daughter. Shows the love and ditermination of a farther wanting her safe and seeking revenge on whoever had taken his her.</p>
<h3>The Bee Movie</h3>
<p>Light hearted animated comedy. I learnt alot about bees and honey from this movie, the aestetic of this move is very satisfying and exciting to look at.</p>
